[View Demo on CodePen](http://cdpn.io/eHzBt) 

Built with love by [JOEY](http://joeylabs.com).


#### Credits
- This CSS3 mouse was inspired by the image found in the first section on [Bagigia](http://bagigia.com) to tell the user they need to scroll. I needed to include something similar in [my own portfolio](http://joeylabs.com) and wanted to flex my coding skills.

#### Setup / Installation
- Clone this repo down and `cd` into it
- Copy the code from `/css` into your Stylus CSS directory. 
- Change the first `$w` variable to change the entire mouse proportionally.
- Change bottom, right values to anything you like, currently this is positioned absolute but you can modify the code as you wish. 
- View `example.styl` to see the Stylus in action
- Compile with your Stylus-powered project.
- Profit!
